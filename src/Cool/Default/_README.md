This module is just a suggestion of how to use Cool and allows users to get started quickly.
If you need to change anything, feel free to copy-paste it in your own project and tweak it as you need.

Note that `DefaultInit` and `DefaultApp` are independent : you can use one but not the other, both, or none.
