## Polaroid

I gave it this funny name because it kind of is a polaroid : it is ready to take a picture (a.k.a. render) at any time, and then the picture (a.k.a. the render_target) comes built-in with the polaroid, you can access it as soon as you render.

Also this class is designed for single use (altough you could reuse it). It is meant to serve as a parameter and not be stored.
